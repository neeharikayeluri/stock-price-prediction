# stock-price-prediction


The project aims to predict the future stock prices of publicly traded companies using machine learning and deep learning models. The study proposes the use of a novel approach Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for stock price prediction and compares their performance with traditional methods such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The project involves collecting real-world stock price data from various sources, preprocessing the data, training and evaluating the models, and comparing the results with traditional methods. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts future stock prices and outperforms traditional methods in terms of RMSE and MAE.
